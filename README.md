# chesster
A chess program and AI that learns to play online at a specified rating level.

When finished, chesster will be usable for human vs. human, human vs AI, or AI vs AI chess play. For the AI to be trained, it will need to be given a target rating level for play on chess.com, and it will need access to an account there. Over the course of some games, it will get better at playing at the level of the specified rating by using a combination of minimax and linear regression to make suboptimal choices among available choices.

Since using a bot on chess.com counts as cheating, I can't guarantee your account won't be banned. 

The AI hasn't yet been written into the program, but some specifications are already ready for once the project enters that stage. At the moment, this is just a nearly-finished terminal-based chess application.
